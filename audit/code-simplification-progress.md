# Code simplification progress

## Objective and working rules

Review the entire codebase for simpler code, meaningful consolidation, prudent
module splits, and low-risk performance improvements. Preserve functionality,
persisted formats, privacy, and trading behavior. The goal remains active;
the batches below do not represent completion of the repository-wide review.

The worktree was clean at the start, on `bb07d8a7`. The user requested a commit
after each turn. Keep completed changes and validation in those commits.

## Review coverage

Initial inventory: 1,910 files under `src`, approximately 332,569 lines including
tests and fixtures. Read the architecture, runtime, and validation guides and
scanned Rust sources for repeated blocks and larger modules. This scan locates
candidates; it does not establish that every module has been reviewed.

| Area | Current coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Startup and layout restoration | Chart and comparison-chart initialization reviewed and consolidated; positioning initialization inspected, still duplicated. Remaining pane/layout flows need review. |
| Charting and canvas | Instance construction, persisted chart settings, annotation loading, and comparison settings reviewed. Rendering and interactions remain. |
| Market data | Mid-price update visibility filtering reviewed; unnecessary catalog copies removed. APIs, caching, symbol lifecycle, books, and other widgets remain. |
| Wallets and account state | Wallet detail and cluster read-result/websocket filters reviewed. Account user-stream handling and risk scrubbing inspected for copies but unchanged. Broader account and portfolio flows remain. |
| Orders, signing, Chase, TWAP | Initial duplication scan only; substantive review remains. |
| Config, persistence, secrets | Chart snapshot/config boundaries reviewed, schema unchanged. Remaining persistence/security code needs review. |
| Subscriptions and transport | Initial duplication scan only; substantive review remains. |
| Feeds, integrations, assistant | Initial size/duplication scan only; substantive review remains. |
| Views, settings, commands, app shell | Architecture mapped; substantive review remains. |
| Tests, scripts, packaging, assets | Validation documentation read; remaining source/tooling review remains. |

## 2026-09-27: chart restoration

- `app_boot/chart_instances.rs` and `layout_persistence/instances.rs` duplicated
  persisted chart settings, quick-trade validation, annotations, and comparison
  settings. Future additions could easily update only one restoration path.
- Added `ChartInstance::from_config` in `chart_state/model/restoration.rs` and
  `SpaghettiChartInstance::from_config` in `spaghetti_state.rs`, used by both
  restoration paths.
- Symbol resolution, muted/hidden-symbol handling, legacy `@0` deferral, cache
  loading, request generations, and session normalization stay in their callers.
  Startup and runtime layout changes intentionally differ in those areas.
- Kept filtering before the quick-action limit and allocated annotation IDs only
  for valid annotations, preserving their order and the mirrored canvas state.
- Moved the layout instance tests to `layout_persistence/instances/tests.rs`.
  Added two integration tests that exercise both restoration paths and compare
  persisted snapshots, including non-default settings, invalid entries, dense
  annotation IDs, comparison modes, and watchlist association rules.
- Updated the charting component guide with the shared ownership boundary.
- No config/schema, message, subscription, dependency, or asset changes.

## 2026-09-27: avoid copies during read-only visibility filtering

- Five update sites copied `exchange_symbols`, `muted_tickers`, and
  `market_universe` solely for filtering while mutating unrelated state fields.
  Full symbol metadata contains owned strings and outcome metadata, so these
  copies are unnecessary work, especially on frequent mid-price events.
- Borrow those fields directly in `market_state/mids.rs`,
  `wallet_state/details.rs`, `wallet_update/details.rs`, and both the REST and
  websocket paths in `wallet_cluster_update.rs`.
- No filtering, account/source checks, timestamps, position freshness rules, or
  task scheduling changed. The Rust borrow checker verifies that the borrowed
  catalog cannot change while the filtering uses it.
- Account user-stream and risk-scrub copies were left alone: they span methods
  that borrow the full terminal and need a separate ownership review.

## Validation

This environment has ALSA development files in a local dependency prefix. Plain
`cargo check --locked -j 2` initially failed to locate `alsa.pc`. Cargo commands
work with these environment variables:

```sh
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/thread/.local/kerosene-deps/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
LIBRARY_PATH=/home/thread/.local/kerosene-deps/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```

- Baseline `cargo check --locked -j 2`: passed with that prefix. Existing
  dead-code warning for `SaveCredentials`, `WalletKeyInputChanged`, and
  `WalletAddressInputChanged` in `message.rs`.
- Baseline `cargo test --locked -j 2 --package kerosene --bin kerosene
  app_boot::chart_instances`: 3 passed.
- New `chart_restoration` tests: 2 passed.
- `cargo test --locked -j 2 --package kerosene --bin kerosene
  layout_persistence::`: 13 passed.
- `cargo check --locked -j 2` after the production changes: passed, with the
  same pre-existing warning.
- `cargo test --locked -j 2` after both batches and the test-module move:
  **4,296 passed, 0 failed, 6 ignored**; doc-tests passed (0 tests).
- `cargo fmt -- --check` and `git diff --check`: passed.
- `cargo clippy --locked -j 2 --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`:
  failed on the three pre-existing unused message variants noted above.
- Diagnostic Clippy run with `-D warnings -A dead_code`: passed. This is not a
  strict-Clippy pass; no lint allowances were added to the source.
- `cargo build --locked -j 2`: passed with the same existing warning.
- Headless smoke: ran the built binary with `--test` under `xvfb-run -a` and a
  20-second timeout. `xwininfo -root -tree` confirmed a 1600x960 **Kerosene
  Trading Terminal** window. Exit 124 was the expected timeout; no panic.
  The only runtime output was an Xvfb EGL/DRI3 acceleration warning, so this
  validates startup, not hardware GPU rendering. In-memory test mode kept
  personal configuration out of the smoke run.

## Next candidates

1. Positioning-info restoration repeats settings and missing-pane instance
   setup in `app_boot/positioning_info.rs` and
   `layout_persistence/positioning_info.rs`. Preserve the different symbol
   fallback rules and runtime pending-request reset when consolidating.
2. Review the three unused account message routes against the current account
   picker/setup flow before removing anything. Searches found only handlers,
   routes, and tests, but credential helper functions have substantial safety
   tests and must be assessed as a complete flow.
3. Review repeated account-picker/layout-switcher styling and comparison-chart
   axis drawing. Similar appearance alone is not sufficient reason to share a
   helper; preserve layout, coordinate, and interaction differences.
4. Continue across the unreviewed areas in the coverage table. Large files often
   include inline tests, so distinguish production complexity from file length.
